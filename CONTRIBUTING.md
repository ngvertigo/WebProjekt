## Key Rules
### Allowed Technologies
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- No Frameworks (Angular, Vue, React, Bootstrap, Tailwind, ...), no external libraries, no package manager (npm, yarn, ...), no server configurations (.htaccess, custom server settings, XAMPP/WAMP, ...)
- Must be separated into distinct files (.html, .css, .js, .php, ...)

#### HTML, CSS
- Semantic HTML: appropriate tags (<article>, <nav>, <aside>) instead of heavy <div> use!
- Responsive Design: mobile friendly layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox, media queries to adjust styles for screen sizes
- Accessibility Features: Ensure Keyboard navigation works, Use ARIA roles if needed
#### JavaScript
- Form validation (check user input before submitting forms (email validation, password strength, ...))
- DOM manipulations (Event Listeners)
- Dynamic Content: Create/Modify elements in the DOM dynamically (f.e. image updates on click)
#### PHP
- File Handling: Read/Write data to JSON or text files
- Dynamic Page Content: Generate parts of the webpage dynamically (loading posts/text from a file)
- ((Maybe SQL is allowed??? TODO: Ask instructor))

## No external configuration required
- The project should work by simply copying the files into a folder and opening it in a web browser or webserver
- entry point must be index.html/index.php
- No tools that require external configuration (of the server)

## Validation Requirements
- Code must pass W3C validation and follow general coding guidelines
- For dynamic content generated by PHP, the output (not the raw PHP code) must validate as well!

## Focus on Accessibility
- Website must include responsive design (mobile friendly)
- Barrier-free access (semantic HTML, proper use of ARIA roles, alt text for images, clear navigation, WCAG2.1 compliant)

## Teamwork
- Everyone must contribute and know/understand the entire project

## Scope
- ~10 different website pages (more or less sites only with valid reason)
- 3/6 concept pages (PDF, answer questions from example document)
